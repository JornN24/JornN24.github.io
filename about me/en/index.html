            <h1>About me</h1>
            <h5>Developer <span2>Sint</span2>Lucas</h5>
            <p>Hi I am Jorn, I am 18 years old and live in the Netherlands. I study Software Development, I do this on the school named Sint Lucas. I am now in my second year, itâ€™s an 4 year MBO education with 2 years of scholarship.
              What I want is to make Programs or websites for big companies or build them for my own, so I want to learn full stack. I already worked with C#, CSS, HTML and Java Script. 
              I also used unity a lot for making some little games or projects. 
              I already made a few projects like Top down shooter, Shine project and T-Rex Game you can see them on this website. 
              I made more cool things that I will add later when they are finished, I hope you enjoy this website a can learn a few things about my, thanks for visiting!</p>
